# Next.js Comments API with Authentication

This is a full-stack project built with **Next.js App Router** to practice my knowledge on:

- CRUD operations with Route Handlers (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- Search/filtering with URL query parameters
- Authentication using cookies
- Middleware for route protection
- Handling headers and cookies in Next.js

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- List all comments
- Search comments with query params (`/api/comments?search=hello`)
- Create, update, and delete comments (requires login)
- Login system with cookie-based session
- Middleware authentication guard

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- [Next.js 15 App Router](https://nextjs.org/)
- TypeScript
- In-memory data (can be swapped with a database later)
